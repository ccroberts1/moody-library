# Moody Library

## Description
This project was inspired by my love of reading and my tendency to read according to a specific mood. My goal is to have a list of the books that I own and provide tags that note the kinds of moods or categories and have a way to input a specific term and retrieve a book that matches. It will be using the MERN stack now that I've gotten more comfortable with those technologies. 

## Required Elements
- Front-end
-- React
-- Semantic UI
- Back-end
-- Mongoose (MongoDB)
-- Express.js
-- Apollo Server
-- GraphQL
- Node.js

## Challenges
- Need to figure out tags in MongoDB
- Unless I want to create moods from scratch, will need to utilize Novelist terms. If I want to make this more universally useful, I'd need to find my own terms later on. 

## Icebox
- Barcode scanner
- Add other users so it's not just for me
