# Moody Library

## Description
This project was inspired by my love of reading and my tendency to read according to a specific mood. My goal is to have a list of the books that I own and provide tags that note the kinds of moods or categories and have a way to input a specific term and retrieve a book that matches. 

## Required Elements
- Webpage with form that can accept input
- Database with book names and associated tags

## Challenges
- I'm already familiar with enough to build out the webpage, but will need to research databases
- Unless I want to create moods from scratch, will need to utilize Novelist terms. If I want to actually make this an app, I'd need to find my own terms later on. 

## Icebox
- Barcode scanner
- Add other users so it's not just for me
